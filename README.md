Welcome to my portfolio! My journey into data management began when I earned my associate degree at Milwaukee Area Technical College, where I learned the fundamentals of database design and data analysis. This foundational knowledge has equipped me to apply my skills across various aspects of data management.

In this section, you’ll find my SQL code. Here, I showcase the steps I’ve taken to achieve proficiency in SQL, demonstrating my understanding of key concepts in database design and data analysis.

Feel free to explore the projects and code snippets that reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for leveraging data to drive insights!
